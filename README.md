# Project: MuseBox [JukeBox Project]

----
## MuseBox


> Juke Box with a few favorite songs; showcasing Vanilla Javascript.

----
## Key Requirements
>Build a music player that will end up playing any mp3 you can find online. Think about what functionality you might need for this to work. Encapsulate all of this functionality in a JavaScript object so that starting a song is as simple as calling Jukebox.play() You need an array of song objects and the ability to play, stop and pause a song. How would you switch songs? Can you shuffle songs? Focus on getting the JavaScript to work and keep the HTML/CSS minimal.
